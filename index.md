I am a Computer Science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- Lab 9, Part 2

    I enjoyed this lab because of its use of the standard library and multiple files. Using file inputs and outputs to transfer data between multiple scripts was very cool to get hands-on experience with.

- Lab 10

    I enjoyed this lab because of its introduction of a more complicated way to navigate and store data. Using a vector within a vector to create extra layers to manage and use data stored within the code was cool to interact with.

- Lab 12, Part 1

    This was a very fun lab to finish the year off with. Not only did it require aspects of moving data around, but it compared moving images to eachother that made it stand out compared to the other labs.
